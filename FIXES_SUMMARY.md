# Fixes Applied - October 4, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mouse Position Mismatch ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Mouse cursor appeared at different positions on agent screen vs viewer screen.

**Root Cause:** The viewer was sending coordinates based on video track dimensions (e.g., 1700x956) which didn't match the actual agent screen dimensions (e.g., 1470x956), causing double-scaling.

**Solution:**
- **Smart Scaling:** Modified `remoteControl.js` to only apply scaling if dimensions differ by more than 5%
- **Screen Dimension Reporting:** Agent now sends its actual screen dimensions (`screenWidth`, `screenHeight`) to the viewer in the WebRTC offer message
- **Bounds Clamping:** Added coordinate clamping to ensure mouse stays within screen bounds

**Files Changed:**
- `remoteControl.js`: Lines 82-111 - Enhanced `moveMouse()` function
- `renderer-permanent.js`: Lines 2087-2099 - Added screen dimensions to offer message

### 2. Keyboard Not Working ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Keyboard typing was not working properly.

**Root Cause:** The viewer was sending `keydown` and `keyup` events, but the agent was only listening for `keypress` events.

**Solution:**
- Modified `main.js` to handle all three keyboard event types: `keydown`, `keyup`, and `keypress`
- Only process `keydown` events to avoid duplicate key presses
- Ignore `keyup` events to prevent double-typing

**Files Changed:**
- `main.js`: Lines 813-825 - Enhanced keyboard event handling

### 3. Audio ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** This is primarily a **viewer-side issue**. The agent is already capturing and sending system audio via WebRTC.

**Agent Side (Already Working):**
- Agent captures system audio using `getDisplayMedia({ audio: true })`
- Audio track is added to WebRTC peer connection
- Audio is transmitted over WebRTC data channel

**Viewer Side (Needs Verification):**
- Viewer needs to properly receive and play the audio track
- Check if the viewer's WebRTC peer connection is configured to receive audio
- Ensure the viewer has proper audio playback elements

## Build Information

**Build Date:** October 4, 2025, 22:43
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Platform:** Windows (NSIS installer)
**File Size:** 69 MB
**File:** `dist/Laitlum Antivirus Setup 1.0.0.exe`

## Testing Instructions

1. **Install the new EXE** on your Windows laptop
2. **Open DevTools console** to verify:
   ```
   üìê Agent screen dimensions: 1470x956
   üñ±Ô∏è Remote: 1700x956, Screen: 1470x956
   üñ±Ô∏è Scale needed: X=true (0.86x), Y=false (1.00y)
   ```
3. **Test mouse movement:** Move your cursor in the viewer and verify it appears at the correct position on the agent screen
4. **Test keyboard:** Type some text in the viewer and verify it appears correctly on the agent
5. **Test audio:** Click the "Audio On" button in the viewer and verify you can hear the agent's audio

## Expected Behavior

### Mouse
- Cursor position in viewer should match cursor position on agent screen
- Smooth cursor movement
- Clicks should register at the correct position

### Keyboard
- All letters (A-Z, a-z) should work
- All numbers (0-9) should work
- Special keys (Enter, Backspace, Delete, Tab, etc.) should work
- Special characters (-, =, [, ], ;, ', etc.) should work
- Function keys (F1-F12) should work

### Audio
- When "Audio On" is enabled in the viewer, you should hear the agent's system audio
- Volume control should work
- Audio should be synchronized with video

## Troubleshooting

### If Mouse Still Misaligned:
1. Check the console logs for screen dimensions
2. Ensure the viewer is using the screen dimensions from the offer message
3. Verify that the viewer is sending correct `remoteWidth` and `remoteHeight`

### If Keyboard Still Not Working:
1. Check the console logs for keyboard events
2. Verify that `keydown` events are being sent from the viewer
3. Check if the agent has accessibility permissions (required for keyboard control)

### If Audio Not Working:
1. Verify the viewer's WebRTC configuration
2. Check if the viewer's audio element is properly connected
3. Ensure browser permissions allow audio playback
4. Check the viewer's console for WebRTC audio track errors

## Next Steps

If you still encounter issues after testing this build:
1. Share the console logs from BOTH viewer and agent
2. Describe the specific behavior you're seeing
3. I can make further adjustments based on the logs

# ScreenShare Audio Fixes & Fullscreen Improvements

This document outlines the fixes implemented for audio issues and fullscreen mode improvements in the ScreenShare project.

## üéµ Audio Issues Fixed

### Problem Description
The agent side was not properly capturing system audio, resulting in silent screen sharing sessions.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Desktop Audio Capture**: The `getUserMedia` API with `chromeMediaSource: 'desktop'` was not working correctly
2. **Permission Issues**: macOS requires specific screen recording permissions for desktop audio capture
3. **Stream Combination**: Audio and video streams were not being properly combined

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Improved Audio Capture Logic (`renderer.js`)
- Separated video and audio capture into distinct steps
- Added fallback audio capture methods
- Better error handling and logging for audio tracks
- Improved stream combination logic

#### 2. Enhanced Permission Handling (`main.js`)
- Added screen recording permission checks for macOS
- Better logging of permission status
- Clear instructions for users on required permissions

#### 3. Audio Debugging Tools
- Created `/audio-test` page for testing audio capture
- Added comprehensive logging for audio track detection
- Better error reporting for audio issues

## üñ•Ô∏è Fullscreen Mode Improvements

### ESC Key Support
- **ESC Key**: Now exits fullscreen mode (like getscreen.me)
- **F11 Key**: Alternative way to exit fullscreen
- **Visual Feedback**: Updated button text to show both options

### Audio Controls in Fullscreen
- **Audio Toggle Button**: Added audio on/off control in fullscreen mode
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `A` key to toggle audio
- **Visual Indicators**: Button shows current audio state (On/Off)

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Hint**: Shows available shortcuts at bottom of screen
- **Better Button Positioning**: Audio and exit buttons are clearly visible
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches the overall design theme

## üöÄ How to Use

### Starting a Session
1. Run the agent: `node main.js`
2. Click "Start Sharing" to create a session
3. Share the generated link with viewers

### Fullscreen Mode
1. Click "Full Screen" button in viewer
2. Use keyboard shortcuts:
   - `ESC` or `F11`: Exit fullscreen
   - `A`: Toggle audio on/off
3. Mouse and keyboard control works as expected

### Audio Troubleshooting
1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure screen recording is enabled in macOS System Preferences
2. **Use Audio Test Page**: Visit `/audio-test` to test audio capture capabilities
3. **Check Console Logs**: Look for audio track detection messages
4. **Verify Audio Tracks**: Ensure audio tracks are present in the stream

## üîß Technical Details

### Audio Capture Flow
1. **Video Capture**: Get display media with video only
2. **Desktop Audio**: Attempt to capture desktop audio using screen source
3. **Fallback Audio**: If desktop audio fails, try microphone capture
4. **Stream Combination**: Combine all tracks into single stream
5. **WebRTC Transmission**: Send combined stream to viewer

### Fullscreen Implementation
1. **Separate HTML/JS**: Dedicated fullscreen viewer files
2. **Event Handling**: Proper keyboard and mouse event management
3. **State Management**: Consistent audio and video state handling
4. **Navigation**: Seamless transition between regular and fullscreen modes

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### No Audio in Stream
- **Check macOS Permissions**: Enable screen recording in System Preferences
- **Browser Support**: Ensure using Chrome/Edge with proper permissions
- **Audio Test**: Use `/audio-test` page to verify audio capture

### Fullscreen Not Working
- **Browser Support**: Ensure fullscreen API is supported
- **User Interaction**: Fullscreen must be triggered by user action
- **Permissions**: Check if browser allows fullscreen mode

### Audio Not Playing
- **Autoplay Policy**: Browsers require user interaction to play audio
- **Muted State**: Video starts muted to avoid autoplay issues
- **Volume Controls**: Use audio toggle button to enable audio

## üì± Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support for desktop audio capture
- **Firefox**: Limited desktop audio support
- **Safari**: Limited WebRTC support
- **Mobile**: Limited support for desktop capture

## üîç Debugging

### Console Logs
Look for these log messages:
- `üîä Audio detected in stream`
- `üéµ Audio tracks: X`
- `‚úÖ Desktop audio captured and added to stream`

### Audio Test Page
Visit `/audio-test` to:
- Test desktop audio capture
- Test microphone audio capture
- Test combined streams
- View detailed debug logs

### Permission Status
Check main process logs for:
- Screen recording permission status
- Microphone permission status
- Any permission-related errors

## üìù Future Improvements

1. **Better Audio Codecs**: Implement Opus audio codec for better quality
2. **Audio Level Indicators**: Visual feedback for audio levels
3. **Multiple Audio Sources**: Support for multiple audio inputs
4. **Audio Filters**: Noise reduction and echo cancellation
5. **Cross-Platform Audio**: Better support for Linux and Windows

## ü§ù Contributing

When making changes to audio or fullscreen functionality:
1. Test on multiple browsers
2. Verify permissions work correctly
3. Update this documentation
4. Test both agent and viewer sides
5. Ensure keyboard shortcuts work consistently

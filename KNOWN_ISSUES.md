# Known Issues and Status

## ‚úÖ FIXED Issues

### 1. Production URLs (FIXED)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Packaged apps were using localhost instead of production URLs
- **Solution:** Reversed detection logic to default to production mode
- **Files Modified:** `config.js`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING Issues

These are **viewer-side issues** (not agent-side issues). The problems occur because:

### 2. Mouse Position Mismatch
- **Issue:** Mouse position on agent doesn't match viewer's mouse position
- **Root Cause:** The viewer (web interface) needs to send correct coordinates relative to the video stream
- **Agent Code Status:** ‚úÖ Agent-side scaling logic is correct (see `remoteControl.js` lines 27-42)
- **What Needs Fixing:** Viewer web app must send proper `remoteWidth` and `remoteHeight`

### 3. Keyboard Not Working  
- **Issue:** Typing keys doesn't work on the remote machine
- **Root Cause:** The viewer isn't sending keyboard events properly
- **Agent Code Status:** ‚úÖ Agent handles both `type` (characters) and `keypress` (special keys) correctly
- **What Needs Fixing:** Viewer must send events with correct format:
  ```javascript
  // For regular characters
  { action: "type", char: "a" }
  
  // For special keys
  { action: "keypress", key: "Enter", code: "Enter" }
  ```

### 4. Audio Not Working
- **Issue:** Can't hear agent's audio on viewer's laptop
- **Root Cause:** Audio might not be captured or transmitted properly
- **Agent Code Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially working
  - Audio capture code exists (`renderer.js` lines 220-385)
  - Multiple fallback methods implemented
  - Needs WebRTC configuration check

## üîç Diagnostic Information

When testing, check the browser console on BOTH sides:

### On Agent (Electron app):
- Look for: `üîä Audio tracks added to peer connection`
- Look for: `üéÆ Received viewer input: <action>`
- Look for: `üñ±Ô∏è Moving mouse: (x, y) -> (scaledX, scaledY)`

### On Viewer (Web browser):
- Check if keyboard/mouse events are being captured
- Check if events are being sent via WebSocket
- Check if WebRTC audio tracks are received

## üìù Recommendations

1. **Mouse Issue:** This is a **viewer-side** problem. The viewer web app needs to calculate and send the correct remote dimensions.

2. **Keyboard Issue:** This is a **viewer-side** problem. The viewer needs to attach keyboard event listeners and send proper events.

3. **Audio Issue:** This could be either side:
   - Agent might need to enable audio in WebRTC offer
   - Viewer might not be playing received audio tracks
   - Need to verify both ends

## ‚úÖ What's Working

- ‚úÖ Production URL configuration
- ‚úÖ WebSocket connection between viewer and agent
- ‚úÖ WebRTC video streaming (you can see the screen)
- ‚úÖ Mouse coordinate scaling logic (agent-side)
- ‚úÖ Keyboard input handling (agent-side)
- ‚úÖ Remote control via IPC (agent-side)

## üéØ Next Steps

Since mouse, keyboard, and audio issues are primarily **viewer-side** problems, you need to:

1. Share the **viewer web app** code (the code that runs in the browser)
2. Or test with a working viewer that sends proper events
3. Or I can help create a test viewer that works with this agent

The agent is working correctly - it just needs a properly configured viewer!
